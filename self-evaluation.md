# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

   I am pretty confident using the each

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

   It was good practice to look through some ruby documentation to learn new methods that would be useful for some of the practice.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

  Continuing to learn the methods that can be used on arrrays and strings to perform useful functions.
  
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
